## TensorCalculus's little double pendulum simulation :D

A cute little double pendulum simulation made using macroquad and rust (I'm still learning, so this is sort of a learning project)! 
Done as a submission for Hack Club's Accellerate (accellerate.hackclub.com)

Features:
RK4 integration for the pendulum
Trail
Adjustment of speed, masses, lengths
Ability to change the **looks** (ofc, the most important bit)

### Please mind the long initial loading time! If you intend to run the exe (in the runnable folder) then make sure to download the WHOLE folder!
